1.16.16 - From Randy
Chris, here is the to do list, I'm taking a break so try to take a whack at it tody:
- Make the stuff on the homepage into an actual usable list for Chloe
- Try to fix the password/username box size, it's giving me stress.
- Maybe try to implement that weather api that changes the bar color if you get ther chance.

Everyone
- I've added a clip-art folder so we can show how expensive a place is, plus what type of place it is.
- I've also added a cop logo (it's like the cash logo, but I was thinking instead of price we use it to show how likely the cops are to show up, so like the Met gets no cops, a seedy bar gets 2 or 3, and a Stuy party gets all five).
- The map button actually works as a link to the map - everything else is up to y'all to install for the time being.
